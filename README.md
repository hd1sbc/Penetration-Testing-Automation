# Penetration-Testing-Automation
A series of scripts to automate penetration testing. This is a copy of "ptestAuto" folder in my "Linux-Addons-And-Programs" repository

# Notes
- The purpose of this duplicate repo is to highlight my pentesting automation knowledge and skills to recruiters and/or hiring managers. This folder is a near-copy of the ptestAuto folder in the "Linux-Addons-And-Programs" repo. That folder will have the most up-to-date versions of the code.
- As of Sept 2024, there are minimal comments. This will be updated
